Purchase Batch Invoicing
========================

This module extends the functionality of purchases to support batch invoicing
purchase orders and to allow you to choose if you want them grouped by purchase

#. Go to *[Your user menu] > About > Activate the developer mode*.
#. Go to *Settings > Technical > Automation > Scheduled Actions > Invoice all
   pending purchase orders > Edit*.
#. Enable it by clicking on *Active* and set the date accordingly.
#. Save.
